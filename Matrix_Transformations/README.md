# Applying Matrix Transformations
In this assignment, I worked on different transformations for a 3D model of a house for Orthographic and Perspective projections. These transformations include: rotate, scale and translate in xy and xz planes.

## Demo

### Usage:

Use the following commands on your shell:
```bash
make template
make run
make clean
```
to compile the program, to run the program, and to delete unnecessary files, respectively.


The following are keys for the Transformations:

                      p      Toggle projection      
```
